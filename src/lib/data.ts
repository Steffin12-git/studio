    detailedDescription: `
### Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands, a prestigious hotel chain, faced declining revenue and market share due to increased competition and inefficient decision-making. They needed a business intelligence solution to guide their strategy.

### My Role & Tasks
As the data analyst, I was tasked to:
- **Develop Key Metrics:** Established critical KPIs like ADR, RevPAR, Occupancy %, and Realisation %.
- **Build a Power BI Dashboard:** Created an insightful dashboard based on stakeholder requirements to track performance.
- **Derive Actionable Insights:** Analyzed the data to find opportunities for revenue growth and operational improvement.

### Key Insights & Recommendations
- **Insight 1: Static Pricing:** Noticed that pricing was the same for weekdays and weekends.
  - **Action:** Recommended implementing a **dynamic pricing** strategy to increase revenue during high-demand weekend periods.

- **Insight 2: High Cancellations on Certain Platforms:** Some booking platforms had significantly higher cancellation rates.
  - **Action:** Suggested optimizing OTA (Online Travel Agency) partnerships or enforcing stricter cancellation policies for underperforming platforms.

- **Insight 3: Top Performing Cities:** Mumbai and Hyderabad properties consistently outperformed others.
  - **Action:** Advised using these properties as **benchmarks** to replicate their successful strategies across other locations.

- **Insight 4: Revenue Driven by Luxury Segment:** The luxury hotel category generated 62% of the revenue despite having fewer properties.
  - **Action:** Proposed creating **upselling strategies** and package deals to encourage guests to upgrade from Business to Luxury rooms.

    detailedDescription: `
### Problem Statement
High employee turnover leads to significant business challenges, including increased hiring costs, productivity loss, and lowered morale. This project's goal was to build a predictive model that proactively identifies employees at risk of leaving and provides actionable insights for retention strategies.

### Tech Stack & Workflow
- **Data Storage & Querying:** Google BigQuery
- **Modeling & Processing:** Python on Google Colab with PyCaret for AutoML.
- **Visualization:** Google Looker Studio for the final dashboard.
The workflow involved collecting and cleaning HR data in BigQuery, training multiple models using PyCaret's AutoML, selecting the best-performing model, and visualizing the predictions in a Looker Studio dashboard for HR teams.

### Model Performance & Selection
A **Random Forest Classifier** was chosen as the final model due to its superior performance.
- **Accuracy:** 98%
- **Precision:** 0.99
- **Recall:** 0.95
- **F1-Score:** 0.97
It achieved the best balance between precision and recall, ensuring that the model could reliably identify at-risk employees without generating excessive false positives. The model demonstrated near-perfect separation on the ROC metric (AUC â‰ˆ 0.99).

### Key Insights & Recommendations
- **Key Churn Drivers:** Job satisfaction, tenure, number of projects, and average monthly hours were the most predictive features for employee churn.
- **Proactive Retention:** The model identified 7 high-risk employees in the pilot program, allowing HR to conduct targeted "stay interviews."
- **Department Focus:** The dashboard highlighted that the **technical, support, and sales** departments had the highest concentration of at-risk employees.
- **Strategic Actions:** Recommendations included implementing employee recognition programs, creating clear career development paths, and offering retention incentives to at-risk employees.

### Problem Statement
AtliQ Motors, an automotive giant from the USA, is planning to launch its best-selling electric and hybrid vehicles in India. The task is to analyze the existing EV/Hybrid market in India, answer key research questions, and present the findings in a dashboard to support the company's expansion.

### Key Metrics & DAX Measures
- **Penetration Rate:** Calculated the proportion of electric vehicles sold relative to total vehicle sales.
- **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Computed the yearly growth rate in EV and total vehicle sales.
- **Top N/Bottom N Ranking:** Used RANKX and dynamic slicers to filter states or makers based on performance.
- **Forecasting:** Projected future sales for 2030 using CAGR assumptions.

### Primary Research Findings
- Identified top/bottom manufacturers and states by EV penetration using dynamic filters.
- Analyzed quarterly sales trends for the top 5 makers.
- Compared Delhi vs. Karnataka EV sales and penetration rates.
- Calculated CAGR for top manufacturers and states to identify high-growth areas.
- Uncovered seasonal sales trends for strategic planning.

### Secondary Research Insights & Recommendations
- **Customer Preferences:** Key drivers are cost savings, environmental impact, and smart features.
- **Government Incentives:** Higher incentives for 4-wheelers (FAME-II) than for 2-wheelers.
- **Infrastructure Correlation:** States with better charging infrastructure (Delhi, Karnataka) show higher EV penetration.
- **Brand Ambassador:** Recommended **Ranveer Singh** for his mass appeal and tech-savvy image.
- **Ideal Manufacturing State:** Recommended **Tamil Nadu** due to its favorable policies, infrastructure, and skilled labor.

### Top 3 Strategic Recommendations
1. **Launch Strategy:** Use a dual EV/Hybrid launch model and a brand ambassador to maximize market reach.
2. **Manufacturing & Infrastructure:** Establish a manufacturing unit in Tamil Nadu and build out charging infrastructure in target markets.
3. **Product & Support:** Deliver high-quality vehicles with robust after-sales service and customer support.
